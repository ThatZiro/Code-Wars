# Multiples of 3 or 5

Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.

The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.

Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!

## Example

```
createPhoneNumber([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) // => returns "(123) 456-7890"
```

## What I learned

- In this challege I played around with creating an arrow function to seperate the string using slicing this method worked great but I enjoyed the creative solution
- The creative solution used Regex to grab the different set of number
