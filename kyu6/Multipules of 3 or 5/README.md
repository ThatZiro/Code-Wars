# Multiples of 3 or 5
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

## What I learned
- By looking at the creative solution I learned that you can easily convert a number to an array of it's previous number
- However the creative solution was fairly hard to reach so I would likely stick to my common solution to follow best practices for readability
